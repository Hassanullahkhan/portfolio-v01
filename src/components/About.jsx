                I've spent the last 3+ years learning and working across
                different areas of development: front-end development, back-end
                development, UI/UX design and currently working for Monipuri
                School and College Science Club as a Web Developer.

                These days my time is spent researching, designing, building
                websites, and coding. I also love to learn and experiment with
                new new things.
